I used OpenMPI on my dual-core macbook pro for this assignment.

The project can be built with:
mpicc gameoflife.c -o gameoflife

and run with:
mpirun -np PROCESSES ./gameoflife

where PROCESSES is the number of processes you want to run it with. It can be run
with 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 processes.

As specified in the assignment, the grid starts with the glider pattern in the upper
left hand corner, and runs for 64 iterations (not including the 0th iteration,
although the starting board is printed out) until the pattern returns to its starting
spot.
